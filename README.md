# Team Spirit Poster

This activity is meant to be an exercise for basic image manipulation with Pillow library.
The goal is to create a digital poster that express themes of the intramurals.

- **Theme:** *“Code Hard, Play Harder”* — blending programming with sports and energy for the design.  
- **Color Palette:** Colors from pink to white range to represent the color scheme of the CCIS team.  
- **Typography:** Futuristic style font (Orbitron) for the digital look.  
- **Design Elements:** 
  - Gradient background
  - Flowchart pattern
  - Binary text over the gradient background
  - School logo & mascot 
  - Sports silhouettes  
  - Central slogan

## Planning
- Planned a layout with a centered slogan, logos at the corners, and a flowchart pattern in the background.  
- Use Pillow to generate a gradient background and layer my chosen PNGs.  
- Use necessary methods to manipulate images to fit the theme.  
- Adjust placements position and resize images for visual balance.
